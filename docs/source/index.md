# MMORE Documentation

MMORE is an open-source multimodal ingestion and retrieval framework designed for heterogeneous document collections.

It provides tools to process documents, build indexes, run retrieval pipelines, support multimodal workflows, and run distributed processing for larger collections and production-oriented settings.

## What is MMORE?

MMORE helps you build retrieval systems over complex document collections by combining:

- document ingestion and processing
- indexing pipelines
- retrieval and RAG workflows
- multimodal retrieval support
- distributed processing support for large-scale document ingestion
- evaluation and profiling tools


## Where to start

Depending on what you want to do, start in different places:

- to install MMORE, read [Installation](getting_started/installation.md)
- to run a first workflow, read [Quickstart](getting_started/quickstart.md)
- to understand the overall system, read [Architecture](getting_started/architecture.md)
- to understand ingestion and indexing, read [Process](getting_started/process.md) and [Indexing](getting_started/indexing.md)
- to work on retrieval workflows, read [RAG](getting_started/rag.md)
- to work on multimodal retrieval, read [ColPali](core_features/colpali.md)
- to run distributed processing, read [Distributed processing](advanced_usage/distributed_processing.md)
- to contribute to the codebase, read [For developers](developer_documentation/for_devs.md)
